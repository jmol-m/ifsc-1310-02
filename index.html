      <h2>Web Accesibility Writing Assignment</h2>
      <p>In my personal opinion, Web Accessibility is one of the most important facets of Web Design. While many may argue the tried and true premise that better accessibility equates to expanded user outreach, I argue that better accessibility may even bolster the loyalty of existing users for which certain accessibility features may not have been designed for. An example of this is icon presentation, which was spoken about by Derek Featherstone. Icons have become a staple on the web, but their initial intended function was to aid the visually impaired and colorblind; despite this, high contrast images which facilitate information on the web are enjoyed by able-bodied users and users that require accessibility features alike. 
        <br></br>
        Good web accessibility has always been met with positive results, but I’d argue that in this day and age they are even more important than ever. When many people think of those who may need to use accessibility features, they may think of the blind, partially sighted, deaf, hard of hearing, or individuals with reduced mobility; what many don't know, however, is that ailments such as Myopia are becoming increasingly common, and accessibility features benefit the near-sighted just as much as the partially sighted. By 2050, Myopia is projected to exist in almost 50 percent of the world’s population, and in Eastern Asian regions, these statistics are even more alarming. While glasses do exist, individuals with high Myopia who take their phones to bed – like myself – often don't wear their glasses to bed, so better visual accessibility and understandability is no longer an option, but instead an expectation.

      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>I had both my mother and sister review my initial revision of my webpage. Not to my surprise, my web page received immediate criticism for the lack of – as they called it – a spark. My project was rushed due to the fact that I have been behind in school, so I unfortunately agree that my first attempt was poor.<br></br>

        According to my sister, she was confused as to why my website did not display any media, and my mother disliked my use of bright colors at the time. In response to their feedback, I changed my assortment of birch and rogue themed web pages to a more assignment-accurate dark techy blue. If not for me checking my website with another individual, I likely would not have remembered to change the colors of the webpage elements.  <br></br>
        
        Personally, I am aware of the innumerable flaws in my directory and webpages. A few of them being: images not displaying properly, images not scaling properly, missing background images (which I would have loved to implement), inconsistent keyword usage… et cetera. These flaws are undeniably a product of my spotty attendance, but I tried my best to catch up yet quickly realized that some of the concepts I thought I had soaked up were not as second nature to me as I had assumed. So unfortunately, this means my revised webpage can hardly be called a first draft. <br></br>
        
        What I did achieve in changing in the revised version is a static footer which persists at the bottom of the browser window when scrolling. This was actually an improvement I made based on my sister making a joke about my Contact link being so unnoticeable. <br></br>
        
        I had hoped to somehow apply the same logic I used on the footer and h6 elements to the boxed section id and create a dropdown menu. But due to time constraints this vision, and many others, were not achieved.<br></br>
        
        Though I wish I could’ve been dealing with fewer hurdles this semester – especially because I was so eager to learn web design – I believe that I have still learned loads. I came into this semester having been the same kid who would mess around in the developer tools, with absolutely no idea of what he was doing; however, I have no come out of this class with at least a extremely basic foundational understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as their interactivity. <br></br>
        
        I will continue to learn Web Development on my own, this class and the chance to evaluate my own XHTML development knowledge truly only has motivated me to learn more.

      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is essentially the practice of prioritizing that the content of a website works throughout the usable majority of browsers and all their variations. In order, the focus is on the content-rich XHTML markup which conveys the purpose of the site. Then prioritize making it more presentable with CSS styling, then finally add interactivity through Javascript. As opposed to the methodology of graceful degradation, which treats structuring the content of a site for older versions of browsers as an afterthought, progressive enhancement puts the practice of careful structuring of content at the forefront, which allows it to naturally degrade far more gracefully.</p>
